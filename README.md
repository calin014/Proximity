# Proximity

Some android game i'm working on, mostly to experiment with and learn android.

**TODO**:
 * implement map add bomb and remove bomb
 * bomb repository
 * link the components togheter / maybe abstractions should be in the core
 * define interfaces for abstractions(map and repositories)
 * test gameplay flows
 * figure out what to leave in activities / services (use mvp or other paradigm?) 
 * rename java folders to kotlin?

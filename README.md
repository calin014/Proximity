# Proximity

Some android game i'm working on, mostly to experiment with and learn android.

**TODO**:
 * write and test abstract rx flows
 * plugin the flows in the activity
 * update to latest sdk and use some permission library based on rx to ask permissions at runtime
 * figure out what to leave in activities / services (use mvp or other paradigm?) 
 * rename java folders to kotlin?
 * investigate rx 2.0
